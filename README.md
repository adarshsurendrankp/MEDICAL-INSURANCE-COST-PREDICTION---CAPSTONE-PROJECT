 MEDICAL-INSURANCE-COST-PREDICTION OF HOSPITAL ABC

 INTRODUCTION

In today's world, where healthcare costs continue to rise, accurately predicting medical insurance charges has become increasingly important for individuals, insurers, and healthcare providers alike. Understanding the factors that impact medical costs can empower individuals to make informed decisions about their healthcare coverage, while insurers can better assess risk and set appropriate premiums. To address this challenge, we present a machine learning project aimed at predicting medical insurance costs based on various demographic and health-related factors.

Using a dataset containing information such as age, sex, BMI, smoker status, region, and insurance charges, we employed several machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, support vector machine (SVM), random forest regressor, and gradient boosting regressor, to develop predictive models. By training these models on historical data and evaluating their performance, we aim to identify the most effective approach for accurately estimating medical insurance costs.

Through this project, we not only seek to provide individuals with valuable insights into the factors influencing their medical expenses but also offer insurers and healthcare providers with a tool to enhance risk assessment and resource allocation. By harnessing the power of machine learning, we endeavor to contribute to the advancement of healthcare analytics and support informed decision-making in the complex landscape of medical insurance.

 OBJECTIVES

The objective of the project is to  predict medical costs for patients based on the various informations given in the data set and analysing the impacts of the factors that influence the medical insurance cost of an individual.
